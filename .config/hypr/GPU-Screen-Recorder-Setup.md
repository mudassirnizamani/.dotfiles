## üìÅ File Naming Convention

All recordings are saved to `~/Videos/` with timestamps:

- **Regular recordings**: `gpu_recording_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.mp4`
- **Mic-only recordings**: `gpu_mic_recording_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.mp4`
- **Region recordings**: `gpu_region_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.mp4`
- **wf-recorder backups**: `screen_recording_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.mp4`

## üîä Audio Configuration Explained

### Current Audio Setup:
- **Microphone**: `alsa_input.pci-0000_05_00.6.analog-stereo`
- **System Audio**: `default_output`
- **Combined**: `default_input|default_output`

### Audio Modes:
1. **Both Sources** (`Super + R`, `Super + Alt + R`):
   - Records your voice AND system sounds
   - Perfect for gaming, streaming, or demonstrating software with sound
   
2. **Microphone Only** (`Super + Shift + R`):
   - Records ONLY your voice, no system sounds
   - Ideal for tutorials, commentary, or when you want clean audio

3. **System Only** (available via audio-config.sh):
   - Records only system sounds, no microphone
   - Good for capturing game audio or music

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Instructions

Super + Alt + R
```

### Instant Replay:
```bash
# Start instant replay (30-second buffer)
Super + Ctrl + R

# Save the last 30 seconds
Super + Ctrl + Shift + R
```

### Manual Script Usage:
```bash
# Full screen recording modes
./gpu-screenrecorder.sh toggle      # Toggle recording
./gpu-screenrecorder.sh start       # Start recording
./gpu-screenrecorder.sh stop        # Stop recording

## üéØ Use Cases

### When to Use Each Mode:

1. **Super + R** (Full Screen + Both Audio):
   - Gaming with commentary
   - Software tutorials with system sounds
   - Streaming preparation
   - General screen recording

2. **Super + Shift + R** (Full Screen + Mic Only):
   - Clean commentary recordings
   - Tutorials without system interference
   - Voice-over work
   - Professional presentations

3. **Super + Alt + R** (Region + Both Audio):
   - Specific application demos
   - Focused tutorials
   - Smaller file sizes
   - Highlighting specific areas

4. **Instant Replay** (Super + Ctrl + R):
   - Gaming highlights
   - Capturing unexpected moments
   - Performance monitoring
   - Bug reproduction

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **No Audio in Recording**:
   ```bash
   # Check audio devices
   ./audio-config.sh list
   
   # Test microphone
   ./audio-config.sh test
   
   # Reset to both sources
   ./audio-config.sh both
   ```

2. **Recording Not Starting**:
   ```bash
   # Check if already recording
   ./gpu-screenrecorder.sh status
   
   # Stop any existing recording
   ./gpu-screenrecorder.sh stop
   ```

3. **Poor Performance**:
   - Ensure hardware acceleration is working
   - Check GPU utilization during recording
   - Verify NVIDIA drivers are up to date

4. **Region Selection Not Working**:
   ```bash
   # Verify slurp is installed
   which slurp
   
   # Install if missing
   sudo pacman -S slurp
   ```

### Log Files:
- Recordings save to: `~/Videos/`
- Temporary files: `/tmp/gpu-screen-recorder-*.pid`
- Check system logs: `journalctl -f` while recording

## üìä Performance Impact

GPU Screen Recorder is designed for minimal performance impact:
- **GPU-only encoding**: Uses hardware acceleration
- **Low CPU usage**: Typically <5% CPU usage
- **Minimal memory**: Uses GPU memory for encoding
- **No dropped frames**: Hardware encoding prevents frame drops

## üîÑ Updating Configuration

To modify settings, edit the configuration variables at the top of each script:

```bash
# Example: Change framerate to 30 FPS
nano ~/.config/hypr/gpu-screenrecorder.sh
# Change: FRAMERATE="60" to FRAMERATE="30"

# Reload Hyprland configuration
hyprctl reload
```

## üìù Notes

- All scripts are executable and located in `~/.config/hypr/`
- Keybindings are defined in `hyprland.conf`
- Audio configuration persists between sessions
- Hardware acceleration requires compatible GPU and drivers
- Instant replay uses system memory for buffering

## üéâ Advantages Over wf-recorder

- **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU-based encoding vs CPU
- **Better Performance**: Minimal system impact
- **Instant Replay**: ShadowPlay-like functionality
- **Superior Audio**: Better audio handling and mixing
- **Wayland Native**: Designed specifically for Wayland/Hyprland
- **Active Development**: Regular updates and improvements
