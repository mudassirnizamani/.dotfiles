## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. No Audio After Enabling Noise Reduction
**Symptoms**: Complete silence or no input detected
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check available sources
./mic-noise-reduction.sh status

# Disable and re-enable
./mic-noise-reduction.sh disable
./mic-noise-reduction.sh enable

# Check microphone volume
./mic-volume-control.sh status
```

#### 2. Audio Sounds Robotic or Distorted
**Symptoms**: Unnatural voice, artifacts, or metallic sound
**Solutions**:
```bash
# For PulseAudio: Try different method
./mic-noise-reduction.sh disable
./mic-noise-reduction.sh rnnoise

# For Audacity: Reduce settings
# - Lower Noise Reduction to 8-10 dB
# - Reduce Sensitivity to 4-5
# - Increase Frequency Smoothing to 5-6
```

#### 3. High CPU Usage
**Symptoms**: System slowdown with noise reduction active
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Use lighter method
./mic-noise-reduction.sh disable
./mic-noise-reduction.sh enable  # Instead of rnnoise

# Close EasyEffects if running
pkill easyeffects
```

#### 4. Microphone Not Detected
**Symptoms**: No microphone sources found
**Solutions**:
```bash
# List all audio sources
pactl list sources short

# Check hardware detection
arecord -l

# Restart audio system
systemctl --user restart pipewire
```

#### 5. Blue Yeti USB Whine
**Symptoms**: High-pitched whine or buzzing (common with Blue Yeti)
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Try different USB port
# Use powered USB hub
# For post-processing: Use Audacity with "Mosquito Killer 4" plugin
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For Real-Time Processing
```bash
# Check current CPU usage
top -p $(pgrep -f "pulseaudio\|pipewire")

# Optimize settings
# - Use 'enable' instead of 'rnnoise' for lower CPU usage
# - Close unnecessary audio applications
# - Use lower sample rates if needed
```

#### For Recording Quality
```bash
# Set optimal microphone volume
./mic-volume-control.sh normal

# Test before recording
./mic-noise-reduction.sh test

# Record room tone for post-processing
# Always record 10 seconds of silence at the start
```

```

### Audio Quality Analysis
```bash
# Check recording quality
file your_recording.wav

# Audio spectrum analysis (if available)
audacity your_recording.wav
```

## üí° Best Practices

### Recording Environment
1. **Room Treatment**: Use soft furnishings to reduce echo
2. **Microphone Position**: 6-8 inches from mouth, slightly off-axis
3. **Background Noise**: Minimize fans, AC, and electronic devices
4. **Consistent Setup**: Same position and settings for all recordings

### Recording Technique
1. **Test First**: Always test audio before important recordings
2. **Room Tone**: Record 10 seconds of silence for post-processing
3. **Monitor Levels**: Keep input levels around 60-70% to avoid clipping
4. **Backup Method**: Have post-processing option ready

### System Optimization
1. **Audio Driver**: Use latest drivers for your audio interface
2. **Power Management**: Disable CPU power saving during recording
3. **Process Priority**: Set higher priority for audio processes if needed
4. **Buffer Settings**: Adjust buffer sizes for your use case
